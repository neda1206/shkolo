Customizable web dashboard.
The dashboard contain a grid of 9 cells. 
Each cell includes a colored button. On click the button user is navigated to the previously set hyperlink.
In case the hyperlink is not set yet, then on button click the user must be navigated to another page, where the user would have the opportunity to set the buttonâ€™s configuration (hyperlink + color).
